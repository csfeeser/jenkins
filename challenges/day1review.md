Let's do a quick project to check our skills we learned yesterday!

1. Create a freestyle project called `Monday Review`

0. Connect this project to a public GitHub repository that YOU OWN and can edit- any repository is fine!

0. From the list below, choose TWO trigger methods to determine when the `Monday Review` project runs:
   - Whenever a change is made to the GitHub repository you chose in step 2.
   - Every 5 minutes
   - After one of the other projects you made yesterday are built.

0. Include a build step that executes the following bash shell when the project runs:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    echo "I hope you enjoyed your first day!"
    ```
